  <h2>Boracay Beach</h2>
  <p>
   Boracay is a small island in the central Philippines. It's known for its resorts and beaches. Along the west coast, White Beach is backed by palm trees, bars and restaurants. On the east coast, strong winds make Bulabog Beach a hub for water sports. Nearby, the observation deck on Mount Luho offers panoramic views over the island. Offshore, coral reefs and shipwrecks are home to diverse marine life.

  <h2>El Nido Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    You’ve probably seen photographs of the stunning limestone formations around El Nido rising majestically above the turquoise water. It is one of the most popular destinations in the Philippines and for good reason, the nearby islands and beaches are absolutely stunning. But the actual town of El Nido leaves something to be desired. The infrastructure has not yet caught up with the massive influx of tourists. Which means a lot of construction, contaminated water, questionable toilets, and high prices.

  <h2>Chocolate Hills</h2>
  <p>
    According to legends, the Chocolate Hills existed because of a weeping giant who had been disappointed in love, and the hills grew where his tears fell. In another legend, two giants went to war and lobbed boulders at each other for days. The giants eventually resolved their differences, but the mounds remained where the rocks landed.

  <h2>Undergroud River</h2>
  <p>
    It’s not surprising at all when Palawan has been recognized as the best island in the world by international travel magazines. With its pristine beaches and breathtaking lagoons, you will never be disappointed at what’s waiting for you. One charming treasure of Palawan that truly stands out is the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.
